# Introduction

In the crypto space are an insane amount of Launchpads, that allow projects to acquire large amounts of liquidity by selling their tokens to early investors. But what happens, if these projects are not intended to go into production and are just a pump & dump' scheme? If the team is not qualified for their goal, or it's a simple scam?

Booster Finance tries to solve the issue of raising money, more securely, without a middleman that takes a big cut of the investment. A project on Booster must be designed using [Milestones](project/milestones.md). In those milestones the team describes a list of goals, they want to achieve at a certain point in time and how much money they need to reach that goal. When a project is funded, the team only receives the money from the [Milestone ](project/milestones.md)they are currently working on. At the end of the milestone, all investors can vote, if the milestone was successfully fulfilled.

The projects are required to do proper project planning ahead of time and the investors have better insights if the project's goals are realistic. When the direction or the quality of the project doesn't fulfill their needs, they can withdraw their remaining funds.
