### Title & Description

The title of the project and a short description \(~ 100 words\).

### Project Logo

Logo of the project to show in the frontend to identify the project fast.

### Link\(s\)

Links to the project site. This will be the most important place to provide feedback from the team and get feedback from the investors. With this information, investors can decide if they want to get involved, stay involved or withdraw their funds from the project.

### Access Type

Whether a project is accessible as described in the section ['Access Types'](access-types.md).

### Timespans

The Timespan for the investment and payout phases. 

### Payout

The amount of money the project will payback to their investors. The payout rate will be determined by the payout timescale and then payout. 

### Min/Max Investment

The team can limit the investment size into both directions. Set a min investment to prevent too small investments that are not feasible with e.g. transaction fees and to prevent spam. Set a max limit to prevent whales from buying the entire supply.

### Min Allocation

The minimum amount that is necessary for the project to be funded. If this is reached the _team can start the project manually._

### Max Allocation 

The maximum amount that people can invest. Setting it too high, may result in a situation where the team cannot repay their investors or not provide adequate interest.

_If the team promises an interst of 25% and only asks for 100.000$, but receives 100.000.000$. They would have to pay 25.000.000$ instead of 25.000$ in insterest._
