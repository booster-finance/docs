  Projects can be public, so everybody can invest, but there may be other
  restrictions to pre-select trustworthy investors like staking Booster tokens
  or a predefined whitelist.

# Access Types

## Public Access \(MVP\)

When the project starts, everyone can invest in the project.

## Staking Access

Every participant needs to stake a minimum amount of the Governance Token into the contract, to gain the ability to buy shares. The more tokens that are staked, the more shares can be bought. The staked tokens can be claimed after the campaign ends or all funds are withdrawn.

## Whitelist Access

The team can predetermine their participants. They can use more elaborate methods by e.g. incorporating social media to preselect participants.
