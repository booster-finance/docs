# Incentiviced Projects

In the beginning, the council will decide what projects will be incentivized. Later this process will be proposed by the DAO and voted on by the token holders. 

## How it works

If a project gets incentivized, it receives a fixed set of Governance Tokens\*. Those will be allocated to participants during the payout phase. 

**\*Bound in a smart contract that can only be paid out to participants.**

## How to get incentivized

Projects can request to be incentivized. The platform will then decide if the project is eligible. Potential factors are:

* Public Team, trustworthy individuals
* Project vision
* Social engagement of project
