# Investment Phase

## Team

The team has created their project on Booster and designed a project plan using the milestone system. To gain more awareness for the project, they share their booster campaign on their social media channels and attract investors. Booster veterans see a new project on Booster and also invest in the project.

## Investors

Investors, who researched the project and are convinced in the success of the project, invest their money in the project. The funds are locked in the smart contract. 

## Phase Ends

When the funding goal is reached, the investment phase ends. The project transitions to the Build phase.
