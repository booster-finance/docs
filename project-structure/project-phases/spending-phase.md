# Spending Phase

The spending phase is the phase between the start of the first and the end of the last milestone. The number of milestones may vary. A milestone consists of two phases of its own: build and vote.

### Build

**Team**

The team gets access to the investment allocated to the first [milestone](../milestones.md). Now they will work to fulfill their objectives in time.

#### Investors

When the first milestone starts, investors can claim their project shares for that milestone. If an investor loses confidence in the project, he can withdraw his/her remaining funds. He keeps the acquired shares and can either keep them or potentially sell them.

#### End

When the team closes the milestone, or the time runs out. Then they vote on the milestone.

### Vote

#### Investors

The investors vote on the milestone. 

#### Ends

The voting phase ends after some time. Then the votes are counted. There will be some time after voting ends, that the investors can withdraw their remaining investment.
