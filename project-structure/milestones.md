# Milestones

A milestone is a list of promises, the team makes to the investors. And the investors can decide in a democratic manner if those promises were kept. A milestone contains of: 

* Funds
* Timeframe
* Objectives

## Funds

For every milestone the project needs to pay their employees, buy assets, invest in marketing, and many more. So the team must calculate ahead of time how much funds they need for that milestone.

## Timeframe

The milestone ends at a certain point in time. Whether the team closes the milestone ahead of time, or when time runs out, the investors will vote on the milestone anyhow.

## Objectives 

The objectives describe what process will be made with that milestone and therefore with the investment of the investors. Investors can check these objectives ahead of time to make up their mind, if they want to invest in that project. You may ask yourself:

* "Are those goals realistic?"
* "Are those objectives relevant?"
* "Is the money they calculate for this objective in-/suffient?
